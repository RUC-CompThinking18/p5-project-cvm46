The change created by the user is swift and obvious, so great work there. More interactivity might have been nice, but, overall, you did well in a short amount of time here.

# Code Quality
You did a lot in a short amount of code here. I would have liked more explanatory comments throughout.

# Aesthetics
Where the project really shines. You fought with it and won!
